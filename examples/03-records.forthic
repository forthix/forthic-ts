# Example 3: Record Operations
# =============================
# Demonstrates record (object) manipulation

# Create a record and store in a variable
[ [.name "Alice"]
  [.age  30]
  [.city "NYC"]] REC .alice !

# Extract a field
.alice @ .name REC@
# Stack now has: record "Alice"

# Update a field by merging
.alice @ 31 .age <REC!
# Stack now has: "Alice" {"name" "Alice" "age" 31 "city" "NYC"}

# Duplicate and get all keys
.alice @ KEYS
# Stack now has: "Alice" record ["name", "age", "city"]

# Swap back to record
.alice @ VALUES
# Stack now has: "Alice" ["name", "age", "city"] ["Alice", 31, "NYC"]

# Expected stack at end:
# [2]: ["Alice", 31, "NYC"]
# [1]: ["name", "age", "city"]
# [0]: "Alice"
